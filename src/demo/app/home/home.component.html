  <h1>An angular network address (IPv4, IPv6 and MAC) input component.</h1>
  <p>ngx-ip is a network address input component for  IPv4/6 & MAC address formats.
    Each block has it's own input element for better UX control.<br>
    This allows highlighting specific blocks with invalid syntax, disabling specific blocks (limit pools, etc...) and more.<br>
    ngx-ip is NOT a mask component, masking is a different approach which uses one input element for the whole IP address.
  </p>

  Install: <strong>npm install ngx-ip --save</strong> or <strong>yarn add ngx-ip --save</strong>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>An example of an IP component in the material theme with the 1st block disabled and the 2nd block invalid.</p>
  <div style="width: 200px">
    <ngx-ip [(ngModel)]="ip"
            [disabledBlocks]="[1,0,0,0]"
            [theme]="'ngx-ip-theme-material'"
            [mode]="'ipv4'"></ngx-ip>
  </div>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to customize the internal <b>input</b> controls <button mat-button color="primary" (click)="openCustomComponentDemo()">Click for @angular/material & @angular/flex-layout Demo</button></li>
    <li>Supports IPv4, IPv6 and MAC address</li>
    <li>Control if user can type invalid characters</li>
    <li>Separator behaves like TAB (e.g: in IPv4 pressing dot (.) is like pressing TAB)</li>

    <li>Implements OnPush</li>
    <li>Supports AOT</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation</h2>
  <p>ngx-ip performs internal validation at the block level to allow invalid block highlighting.<br>
    Block validation does not replace form validation, if you use angular forms you still need to validate the output, as you need with any other control.
  </p>

  <h2>Should I use ngx-ip or mask?</h2>
  <p>Well, this really depends on you'r requirements, here are some key points:</p>
  <h3>Copy / Paste</h3>
  <p>ngx-ip offers better UX but since it has multiple input elements it has a different copy/paste (CMD/CTRL-C/V) behaviour.<br>
    When pasting, ngx-ip will auto detect the content and handle full address automatically.<br>
    When copying, ngx-ip has 3 copy modes to choose from, these modes fire only if the whole text in a block is selected otherwise copy behaviour is native<br>
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Block mode:</strong> This is similar to the native copy mode, when fired it will copy the content of the block.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Address mode:</strong> This will copy the whole address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Select mode:</strong> Once fired the user will be prompted to select Block or Address copy.<br>
        This mode is not supported in browsers that does not support the document.execCommand('copy'); method (Safari 9), if set in such browser it will fallback to Block mode.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Rendering</h3>
  <p>
    ngx-ip renders more input elements. This should have no effect on performance, unless you render 1000+ components and if you do you're doing something wrong :)<br>

    If this is a deal breaker for you you should definitely use a mask component, here are some examples <a href="https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/tree/master/angular2" target="_blank">Text Mask</a>, <a href="http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/inputmask" target="_blank">PrimeNG Input Mask</a>, etc...
